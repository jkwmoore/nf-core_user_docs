## SBC Guide to Running Nextflow with nf-core Pipelines on ShARC

This guide describes the main steps required for setting up Nextflow and nf-core on ShARC.

Nextflow is not currently available on ShARC as an environmental software module. The simplest solution is to install Nextflow and nf-core into a Conda environment using a personal install of miniconda. These processes are described as part of this guide.
