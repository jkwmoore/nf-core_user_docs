# Submitting a Pipeline to the SGE Scheduler on ShARC

Once you have fulfilled all of the requirements above, you should be ready to submit your batch job to the SGE scheduler on ShARC. From the project root, type the following:

```bash
qsub ./scripts/nf_submission.sh
```
Your pipeline run should start momentarily. Good Luck!
